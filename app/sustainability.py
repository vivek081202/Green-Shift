        By understanding these impacts, families and societies can begin to recognize the importance of sustainable population growth.

        **Fact:** Livestock farming, especially beef and dairy, contributes to **14.5%** of global greenhouse gas emissions. Beef production is the 
        most carbon-intensive, accounting for a significant portion of these emissions due to methane produced by cattle.

        Shifting towards plant-based diets is a critical step in reducing personal and global carbon footprints.
